# pentestingtools
A list of my personally used pentesting tools. The used repos are in the submodules, just install those. 

Installation command is the following:


  ``git clone https://github.com/TClark19/pentestingtools.git --recursive``

However, you will still have to install the given tools when in use. Check their individual repo's for installation instructions. For example, you may need some specfic python versions or environments, etc.
