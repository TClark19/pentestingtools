# pentestingtools
A list of my personally used pentesting tools, able to install everything needed for pentesting. Used repos are in the submodules, just install those. 

Installation command is the following:


  ``git clone https://github.com/TClark19/pentestingtools.git --recursive``

However, you will still have to install the given tools when in use. Check their individual repo's for installation instructions.
