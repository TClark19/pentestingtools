# pentestingtools
A list of my personally used pentesting tools. The used repos are in the submodules, just install those. 

Installation command is the following:


  ``git clone https://github.com/TClark19/pentestingtools.git --recursive``

However, you will still have to install the given tools when in use. Check their individual repo's for installation instructions. For example, you may need some specfic python versions or environments, etc.

All of the tools found in this repo should be OSCP friendly, and should let you get through several boxes on hackthebox with minimal involvment from metasploit (you can use the handler and msfvenom on the exam). 

My goal for this repo is to compile enough tools that enumeration, penetration, and escalation is (relatively) easy to perform. Git also provides a nice way to keep these tools mobile while moving through a network, but that may not be good opsec :(
